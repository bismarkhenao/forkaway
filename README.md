## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Write or update tests
5. Commit using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   # Examples:
   git commit -m "feat: add new cleanup option"
   git commit -m "fix: handle error in fork deletion"
   git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
   ```
6. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Open a Pull Request

### Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This helps us automatically generate changelogs and version numbers. Common types:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `chore:` Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bismarkhenao/forkaway.git
   cd forkaway
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up development environment:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your GitHub token
   ```

4. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   # For development
   npm start
   
   # For testing
   npm test
   ```

   The start script runs your TypeScript code directly with proper ESM support.

### Automated Workflows

- Tests run automatically on Pull Requests
- When PRs are merged to main:
  1. Version is automatically bumped based on commit messages
  2. Changelog is automatically updated
  3. New version is published to npm
